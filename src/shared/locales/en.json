      "paragraph1": "No one knows exactly when Mes/Tej was first produced, but the earliest dated mention of the beverage is found in Aksumite writings. Aksum (Axum) was a kingdom that primarily encompassed today's northern Ethiopia and Eritrea, but during its peak, it dominated both sides of the Red Sea. The language spoken in Aksum was the now-extinct language, Ge'ez. It is also from the Ge'ez language that the word for honey wine, 'mes,' originated.",
      "paragraph2": "In the book, Inscriptions de l'Ethiopie Antique, the Dutch scholar A.J. Drewes translates Aksumite texts about Mes/Tej written in Ge'ez. The texts show that it was primarily royalty and nobility who consumed Mes/Tej; it was served together with injera and various meat stews—a practice that continues to this day!"

Buckwheat mead represents the bold, unapologetic side of mead-making. It's not a beginner's mead, but rather a sophisticated choice for those seeking depth and complexity beyond typical honey wines. The intense earthy character can be challenging initially, but reveals remarkable complexity and nuance for those willing to explore its depths. This is a mead that commands attention and respect, offering a drinking experience that's both primitive and refined, simple yet profoundly complex.",
